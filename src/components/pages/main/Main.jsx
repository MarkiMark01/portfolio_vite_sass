          Hi, I'm Markiyan, a Junior Frontend Developer with a passion for
          creating modern,
          <br /> user-friendly websites and applications.
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve worked on several personal projects where I gained hands-on
          knowledge <br />
          and improved my problem-solving skills.
          <br />
          I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute my skills, continue
          learning,
          <br /> and grow professionally.
        </p>
